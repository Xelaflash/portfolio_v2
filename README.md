This is the V2 of my porfolio website launched in April 2022, to show my profile, my stack and my work. This website is a SPA made with NextJs 12, Styled-components and powered by Notion API (stack & projects). It's a simple website but I've tried to polish the small details of the UI/UX. Hope you'll enjoy it,as much as I do.
